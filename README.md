Navigation Nutrition is a fun and interactive application that educates people about nutritional health and allows users to track the health of their food in a fun way. Navigation Nutrition's goal is to take out the major boring and serious issues around nutrition. We want people to have good healthy stomachs without feeling the pressure of most nutrition-based apps that are about losing weight or tracking calories.
